tennessee lowered quite bit seven point five million know virginia twelve million back 2017 see states actually went sales 2017 2018 know worksheet right shows products total sales total sales overall know region went year passed want see explore underlying trend states sold less product states sold nothing states lower sales know explore next sheet sheet basically map different format right set

million sales 2017 went twenty one point four million 2018 that's nine million dollar change see trend actually going north carolina thing went point million thirteen point three tennessee twenty one point six seven point five know keeps going exceptions easier see bar graph map georgia 2017 ten point five million whereas 2018 fourteen point five sales actually went georgia whilst went almost every state also see slight change asked recognizable map previous worksheet arkansas 2017 four point nine million sales whereas 2018 5.0 speck change georgia states nonetheless sales whereas every state georgia actually went worksheet item sales southern region year worksheet fairly self-explanatory two pie charts one year 2017 one 2018 year i've actually done chosen pie chart order showcase

overall let's click flag sold item overall south click see map changes shows sold see tennessee florida sold 2017 five million five point five million tennessee five point four florida click 2018 give 2018 sold two point three florida one point tennessee even see going back 2017 even stopped selling oregon organ low number 2017 stopped overall sales arkansas assuming company thought unprofitable keep selling product arkansas making little money number big enough include data right could couple dollars enough know make significant change data actually see 2018 georgia saw trend georgia went sales right 2018 georgia nine point nine million sales five percent whereas 2017 one eight million dollar boost surprising keep exploring story we'll explore couple different products years see products changed began selling started selling less stopped selling overall story going show different trends item sales per state previously explained worksheet dashboard first story board see

easily tell trend every state going sales year two years except georgia arkansas right pie charts discussed earlier used look data closely see slice pie changes depending year depending item click item it'll show changed whether got bigger whether got smaller basis discussing next storyboards alongside map used dashboard overall dashboard utilizing story order analyze data right going start analyzing paper towel sales 2017 state next story board 2018 found follow pattern like we're different items chosen two years compare sales see went went states start selling states started selling etc right see 2017 paper towel sales know million florida hundred thirty one thousand georgia there's numbers pie chart 2017 show size pie actually pretty small states included paper towels sold arkansas kentucky mississippi alabama south carolina states southern region might maybe customers buying different brand profitable enough move 2018 see lose louisiana going back 2017 louisiana 2018 lose louisiana leek game kentucky look bottom paper towel slice pie actually looks little smaller see back 2017 sales louisiana 594 thousand kentucky they're much even though replaced 470 although sales significantly tennessee states see paper towels sold northern portion southern region southern portion job know one biggest hits want say limited eliminated louisiana replaced basically kentucky terms numbers tennessee went georgia georgia florida sales actually went significantly next step could take terms paper towels would remove florida selling paper towels sales went million two hundred fourteen thousand continue sold try different market next story voice nature valley protein chewy bars 2017 actually big big portion 2017 pie chart see numbers stand north carolina million florida two arkansas virginia well tennessee actually missing louisiana south carolina even though holds large slice pie two states actually selling move 2018 size pie seems reduced two states added south carolina started selling louisiana south carolina low number 38,000 cannot actually compare lot introduced market know know well keep future back forth north carolina million went million big change compared know states million million florida actually went biggest north carolina keeps decreasing market removed altogether making enough sales justify production costs move dubs advanced moisture conditioner 2017 see slightly smaller slice pie still nonetheless pretty big sold almost every state alabama states stand north carolina georgia georgia trend georgia actually one states 2017 2018 increased sales see know increase chewy bars actually decreased paper towels doves advanced moisture conditioner actually went well also noticeable data stopped selling south carolina arkansas louisiana three states eliminated making enough profit look pie chart decrease know size states stopped profitable know georgia north carolina went two million 815 georgia 669 north carolina markets going considered well southern region starts keeps going advanced conditioner we're going make different cuts region terms dunn's advanced moisture conditioner mix though that's biggest chunk pie right 2017 sold every state pretty large quantities 4.5 million tennessee million know amongst others move 20:18 florida tennessee went know jump back look actually arkansas stopped sold makes lot sense know already state performing least sales removed overall georgia georgia went one nine million sales jump sales actually increased overall replace lost amongst things represents biggest chunk pie change saw bar graph previously saw every state going georgia going see represents must wonder arkansas point five million wanted actually stopped selling sold product south keep going trend

stuff selling i'll take look like personal hygiene product different departments well yeah also added profit margin raw data would like see data actually probably supposed that's see cells how's profit going adding profit profit margin bad idea also thing region we're gonna focus center eased focus western area also talk whole state well here's state nice cds right nice right see first put together big graph bar graph better vision we're looking what's difference compare right clearly see 2017 lot better 2018 nearly almost olive stuff think almost 50% near 50% cells decrease 2018 order i'm gonna look regions see certain regions cells going cells going right let's take look right central area grocery department decrease much however paper prats actually decrease lot following personnel products also look one actually decreasing make assumption hey maybe price changing maybe people much money buy population changes times would consider starting business we're analyzing business data set that's done three departments choose one person kind kind narrowed area we're going focusing think personnel good example since really good differences think think use determine what's really going sales going let's back central area actually goes except person person nails moisturiser conditioner doves look they're actually start drop little bit product well see full pages matter region total sales always less 2018 must dump something make sales decrease cut something personally think nationwide problem could locations right use selling look location explain little bit desk sheet 2017 selling locations 2018 selling locations right bet tell area area changed lot guys see area selling spots lot 2017 however 2018 decrease significantly amount also coastal area priests buy also see area 2017 buttons actually open new stores right let's make guess let's say people let's say rents high area right area owner hey written high want paint much let's move west little bit see what's going remove locations west like there's stores right seventh kind move stores think checker south decrease cuz need think every location cost living maybe area i'd say could chicago people area get paid make monies care hygiene products instead people area let's say people area willing pay $10 bottles $10 per bottles soap they're okay people area old $10 much i'm gonna pay could trigger cells going also problems right california san francisco's area right tell actually stores closing right three they're gonna move actually kind decreases area right here's used one store kind closed right used store there's three right stores closing kind move store new mexico area another thing people new mexico may want pay much money bottle conditioners care much like can't afford much let's say put focus san francisco area like coastal line area could yeah could less mentioned rent high owners can't afford want cut causes however considering kind stuff also consider cost living also consider people they're also considered generation people maybe people live area younger care kind things maybe area people younger instead area people older particularly kind products also may sheet like conclusion put line guys understand see clearly line means negly also put together dashboard dashboard shows locations shows house house changed different locations we're gonna take look make small example let's central area central area decreasing decreasing let's look locations maybe they're opening animating closing locations right central well let's see store right still opening right snooze stores closing hear stores spread instead focus big cities well here's lot stores closed here's one store that's closed one store closed 2018 i'm sure closed affects think good decision really consider factors well maybe another example sell sell change much much millions right millions take look right mmm chad say florida change much move locations that's good sign there's change sales would decrease something right open stores right 2017 lot stores open opening right could rent cheaper that's opening stores right could raisins can't determine hope yeah reason still dig little bit make another dashboard profit margin give guys data compare side side see what's really going one mainly focus west area look west right seems like lot change actually change lot right first one 2007 making good profit closed dislocations open one pretty good ever store still profiting know shut store decrease sales keep going see right here's big chunk stores blink closed 2018 another million dollars companies lost million dollars closing new locations like here's lot stores used lot stores closed stores think way saying want hey tap cost think owner considering factor see right here's big decrease area could maybe right phi store use used like maybe five eight store right maybe five store left two stores closed profits lost right seventeen here's lot stores opening 2017 however cells gone knut randy decided move new locations also another problem new locations owner really considered move new locations people know let's say live city sudden there's new store coming know what's store idea store hand owner spend lot money advertising i'm discount sales they're properly sales would decrease well remember advertising exposure speeds really high nowadays yeah personally think

got excel sheet data looked like bunch numbers words make much sense however investigated dived started realize company trying sell items across nation saw city state zip code within within data selling cells they're showing cells statistics profits extent statistics i'm tasked creating tableau worksheet used given data first started tableau software following worksheet basically map united states circles represent cell city see first noted notice map northeast we're new york city new jersey area densely populated circles means there's high sales could mean high profit see there's lot silver circles right circle means larger means sales darker meat means higher profit however mean they're cells conducted see there's sales conducted california washington oklahoma illinois area majority looks like conducted northeast one thing also picked larger sales conducted also oklahoma california see basically shows set sales taking place importance cell see bigger important means money company second second thing tableau bar chart bar chart listed items basically wanted worksheet showed items compared see conditioner popular item kleenex least popular item may actual quality maybe people area use conditioners area maybe kleenex much used united states mean maybe people use like paper towels like standard shows data easier way see dan describe happening happening created basically compare see item sells nationwide second thing sales versus profit horizontal bar chart reason comparing items map saw city high sales high profits like see seattle high sales profit high sales see sales million profit less double less double really mean poor basically basically shows cells actually mean high profit company jump conclusions could means point trying talk executives managers fourth stand graph gonna stand three circles circles stood like one one one basic represent high sales high profit three cities repair cities three standout cities see they're popular cities like new york city los angeles could reason they're high sales profits high population thought really cool graph show statistics dashboard took map united states graph like bar chart items basically thought complement well can't really see item nationwide could consumed individually city shows nationwide let's say new york city click new york city see phone men item really give graph nationwide even though new york city shows really selling really good shows actually pretty well finishing wide compared items new york city really give nationwide view graph however graph give specific view map graph thought complete rather well story basically use explaining i've explaining explaining explained worksheet panels start one basically says locations sales profits captured name says looking map plots every cell conducted company using given data investigated determine regions selling better making profit example looks like northeast home region sales profit based cluster circles basically i've explaining explained basically shows selling item well ichi wow new york city sells conditioner phone men well say like columbus really selling see we're right we're fayetteville really something much may cultural thing fayetteville compared new york city maybe there's big population fayetteville fair safe basically age there's enough people buying basically that's explaining second frame bar bar chart captioned bar chart shows items selling better making profit overall almost captured using key data y-axis bars show item performing market table bar means higher number sales also darker bar higher profits item overall using chart determined ion conditioner best selling major size profit well know kleenex low lowest performing sales profits basically saying chose overall might region overall nationally nationally highest lowest selling items third panel horizontal bar chart captured graphic shows concern comparisons sales profits graphic created show house sells transferred profits like show even though city may high sales profits sales could low due issues like high expenses low pricing like seattle high sales lower profit compared sales basically would say high sales mean gonna high profits result let's like examples like seattle maybe expenses labor laws little different wages pay people maybe translation costs higher need like smaller airport much transportation area there's many reasons graph graphic really depth shows data responsibility dive deeper fourth one standout one call doubt graphic he's sizes show chitti highest sales best selling put comments graphic help hurt business city item best cities need limit focus like new york cities less cities one cities highest sales conditioner montgomery's lower nacelle say however graphic show statistics reasons like saying population could huge factor take consideration yeah basically saying shows data reasons data shows three popular circles bigger circles new york city los angeles may due population culture well comparison cities like tampa irving stood wilmington fire let dashboard captioned dashboards great mix showing company selling office products wide depth product overall comments said dashboard create lot questions like product best shitty best example let's say choose new york city see high sales profits look highest selling item conditioner also highest selling item overall yulin lead questions like population seat responsible sales item responsible sales ina may high quality maybe like however maybe like maybe there's lot competition conditioner market new york city that's selling high selling high places there's lot factors could dive explained ultimately i've learned lot tableaus first time tableau software like great tool use working company company show data organized way without confusing people show data like know even know use like different graphics tend tableau software like shape data way want better convey meaning data thought really cool i've

states what-have-you came find that's necessarily case many aspects profitable like looking california right total sales 253 plus million plus that's pretty considerable considering know back sheet cents profit margin right still good like top range top mark like missoula north charleston even make top percentile total profitability really like correlation sheet sheet i'm gonna move sheet want realize simple sheet know feel like business owner determining know move forward what's best possible route maximizing profit reducing losses actually really simple sheet extremely effective take two years take current year previous year total sales right looking horns current year 2018 right total sales 535 million plus right looking 2017 see based coloring graph 2017 considerably better total sales know might lead certain business owners start questioning hey need like start making adjustments whatnot know thought perfect looking sheet one right make adjustments wanted make certain cuts certain places right start well see item right profitable could probably better profitable least profitable much could potentially maximizing resources eliminated item decided allocate know one profitable items that's something business owners consider another thing would right shows top percentile cities cities top percentile profit margin means say adjust adjust filter show cities profit margins could say hey know new cities would show would bottom forty percent tile could potentially know cut cities decide allocate resources opening branches profitable cities like say california texas things nature that's really like sheets kind tie together know sim shows importance know like company bad track one necessarily know first glance look great know sales decreased 300 million total looking want make change want maximize profit know start could start specific items could start location know geographics play important role maximizing profit we're gonna dashboard decided decided compile sheets know sheets feel like kind fit nicely know sheet one like said simple items know profit total profit per item see filters right wanted adjust profit margins showed sheet see there's reduced number cities appearing circles say right wanted increase even one city reaches percentile profit margin know that's something consider business owners know something could played around decided want adjust requirements know moving forward company say decided wanted show every single city profit margins could could look analyze hey know starting right wanted get strict requirements know decide locations know we'll keep running make simple adjustment know see there's less less circle showing circles begin minute diminish early could look making adjustments locations story know sheets also comments along low battery comments along like said earlier sheet one shows proper product know shows cities problem nastasya percentile states 60th percentile total profitability also shows total sales know compares current year previous year total sales know story right interactive dashboard know users business owners readily accessible manipulate certain filters requirements whatnot yeah tableau project appreciate time good day

finally see please enjoy project hope find enlightening mining xited thank i'm charity frank's tableau project i'm gonna taking tableau file showing data graphics graphs visualizations sort break data grocer's distribution chain we're gonna see sort conclusions draw data sorts graphs helpful trying dig deeper drill deeper see trends areas concern we're going start looking basic look data we're going great meet enjoy ride starting see data exported directly excel see yeah country data points united states region whether central western eastern southern state come zip we're really gonna use much data city sales sales date breaks either 2017 sales sale made 2018 department items came sold fit specific items sold sales well amount profit gone sale we're gonna take look first graphic see sort small window basically make many different bar graphs fitted little window show basically show average sales grocery store peter's products department 2017 2018 show average profitability shade ingredient tell see shading gradient shows let's get way see lower end dark orange upper end dark blue sort gradient shows products profitable larger could actually see entire names products they're broken top department come side region come years products sold tell know well lot regions we're poorly 2017 made improvements 2018 see western region made little gains whatever gains made know backtracked lot decreases profitability we're going take look later see detail bar graph useful basically comparing comparing broad information like comparing okay selling better grocery products paper products personal products good showing trends time we'll take look something like later see rows columns average sales gives little bit better picture sum sales region year opener department item yeah we're gonna gives kind breakdown get big idea what's going data we're gonna depth drill next graphic see we've focused we've honed western region said earlier profitability extremely low region we're looking sales versus profit we're still looking bar graphs looking two different bar graphs essentially showing difference overall amount money gained selling product department actually profit actually took home sales costs subtracting looking tell know suspected western region significant profitability problems expect profitability somewhat lower sales course take costs we're taking home everything make sale pay get made pay pay manufacturer know lot cases see profitability significantly lower need see maybe places improve already see paper products department especially serious problems come detail later gives better picture going profitability sales actually good representation much money we're making selling products see really know see trends look closely item bar graph help visualization help want spend time actually see items increasing profitability items decreasing profitability we're using average profitability average sales moving profit map giving minute load see zoom map united states america lagging little bit right map specifically filtered western region want actually see states better terms profitability states pulling home profit sales states poorly let's zoom little bit see california one large states extremely high population density wealthy city's affluent cities see looking really well terms profitability average profitability that's concerning like new york back look data new york significantly well terms profitability affluent customers area high population density states expect lot people going going stores purchasing products profitability higher concerning california low see states actually seem actually seem well terms profitability going probably going hone next graphic gives nice visual representation states relation one another know trends see concentration low profitability graphic helps see know areas concern areas might want see detail areas need see breakdown products department individual products order see selling selling see surprisingly areas well west red states ones really dragging profitability regions helpful get closer look what's going state-by-state basis turning honed look bar graph focuses solely california see breakdown product average profitability learn later decent gives snapshot things look like products selling products sewing really want see later get look time going trends happening gives accurate picture we'll see later facial tissues relatively high average profitability compared products necessarily tell trend time product actually decreasing profitability profitability we'll see later helpful see products need focusing next graphic next visualization much better let's take look basically final graphic besides story data interactive dashboard see product thought well actually seen significant drop 2017 2018 line graph several line graphs actually can't really tell small window 2017 included columns see products broken department individual product side color coded see average profitability left that's what's measured yeah gives line graph showing what's happening 2017 2018 see actually lot products well increasing profitability significant drops kirkland products paper products bringing entire profitability state extension region need hone find perhaps consider discontinuing products they're going increase they're going continue trend probably need data going 2019 help see long-term trend something corrected causes trend actually they're poorly thought know states products steadily increasing business grocery store owning look individual skus see ones gaining popularity ones worth perhaps take look costs see products expensive purchase manufacturer makes worth even though making profit california means cost real estate wherever store probably extremely high costs outside even purchasing cost goods sold know purchasing making products need take consideration california profitable might want move another state interactive graphic see mixture sheets mixture profit nap bar graph saw california lowest prophet prophet items west broken average profit individual item great thing interactive graphic know click individual state like california example gives breakdown profit average profitability item state states see interesting trends like example state profitable item might want find different different project might want drill find going state make item profitable think items profitable comparison day see good mixture items state good mixture items profitable one interesting state found obviously california really want focus want see what's going course snapshot give elite picture get fooled high know perception high profitability montana saw know blue state can't see gradient one highly profitable states area western region see one product mainly driving statistic might give misleading look look interactive traffic group sheets that's benefit group sheets also click see moment yeah essentially click individual item give breakdown state item see shows shows breakdown state see zoomed look okay bars different states shampoo napkins that's great thing interactive graphic useful larger would evident take word open file finally we're going take look may story stories basic premises get profits western region specifically california we're focusing changing average profit wearing states low let's take look i'm widescreen mode can't quite see can't quite see everything presentation mode hopefully see see starting story takes first graphic first visit visualization graphic remember bar graph shows know let look take top average sales items department broken year region see regions someone's premium sales past year west decided drill find products contributing went kind drilled looked sales versus profitability west yes suspected sales vary appear high profits remain low outliers product product suspected outliers mostly profits far lower sales need take look see map underperforming departments west see yes areas concern west especially california high density population area move average profit west lowest item see california extremely poorly drill see departments performing worst see line graph come conclusion facial tissues paper towels greatest right left last time sorry story profits western region united states saw bar graph showing okay basically snapshot different states sign underperforming item average profit like extreme outliers we're focusing honing california since state performing well see outliers performance average profitability pretty low drill even see items departments performing worst get final graphic final fizzles visualization see grouped greatest contributors decline profits facial tissues paper towels everything else okay decreasing increasing dramatic drops probably affecting overall average profitability grocery stores entire state probably western region great thing specific type chart like said earlier see able see thing larger 2017 2018 see declines get see basically get see profitability time that's advantage line graph certainly show breaks know individual item department single state going average profitability time year gap 2017 2018 see products dramatic drops paper products they're kirkland products draw one know one two conclusions even conclusions contributed either know california lot eco-friendly movements climate change large concern people trying find alternatives paper towels facial tissues seen wasteful use discard could eco conscious movement western coast that's causing decline sales hence profitability item likely since they're kirkland products probably cost factor play example manufacturer kirkland could simply gone prices we're still selling amount we're still selling amount cost significantly profit average profit going that's common problem grocery chains typically solve problem longer purchasing suppliers manufacturers instead know stock store products may solution issue discontinue products profitable probably restock products much better profitability increasing two two options eco-friendly thing issue hand might want consider going eco-friendly brand try appeal specific consumers sensibilities suspect kirkland gone prices whatever reason maybe wildfires need wood paper scarce they're compensate passing cost purpose per person they're supplying grocery store chain perhaps need case can't helped price pass cost consumer could adverse effects well probably probably discontinue products things change also get better picture data going back 2019 see maybe temporary setback 2018 see temporary setback even collecting 2019 2020 data going forward see maybe things rebound profit back change minds probably continue products that's probably solution need quick rundown tableau two product project conclusion drew based data tableau great software really comprehensive many different ways displaying data process enormous amount data there's 7,000 points data set amazing able process quickly offer many different charts many options displaying data place super intuitive use place automatically selects graph shows maybe need want select certain type graph it'll it'll recommend need graphs even switch axes get different look yeah really great software learned lot looking learned sorts graphs advantageous use combining graphs even dashboard interactive dashboard incredible feature learned great way disappointing data take two graphs sort combine trying tell people presenting learned lot product project learned lot working tableau really liked although setbacks know issues displaying know profit negative profit think overcame showing average profit lot people say forum's better indicator sometimes what's going data got really good look what's going know store feel like conclusion drew sound concludes presentation tableau two product project hope enjoyed thank "

begin let explain data data represents sales profit profit margin twelve different items within three different departments information gathered across united states begin started filtering filtered based region see first worksheet sales department south felt like easier kind get idea data representing picking section picking section chose represent sales profit whole lot sales resources super expensive they're high cost could deficit could could losing money regardless much making sales that's chose analyze one first see profit sales proportionately via bar graph look y-axis see profit ranges zero dollars million dollars sales zero dollars fifty million dollars that's drastic difference yes they're still making money obviously much sales appears still they're making profit chose section based department see red personal yellow paper products blue grocery see states south x-axis i'm drawing cursor around also see yeah sales profit state stuff next filter chose duplicating document changed graph instead bar graph wanted map map felt based state chose florida see florida highest amount profit sales thought well there's gonna lot data i'm gonna take look florida i'm florida little pie charts represent department's grocery paper products personal different sizes chose base size pie chart sales see top right corner look firsthand looking see jacksonville probably largest pie chart next miami tampa decent size wanted visually represent visually represent data geographically see across florida south north data across state numbers sales particular department says personal also saying five million 5.7 million sales department transitioning third worksheet sales item florida colors based department red personal like everything else said yellow paper products blue grocery wanted take look personal department thriving well see toiletries shampoo conditioner grocery either bars paper products napkins paper towels usual items one facial tissues feel like different way representing information geographical map visualization since red largest base amount sales see sales underneath items yeah chose pursue profit want take look sales even though know sales profit proportionately know sales bigger number wanted sales anyways see graph tree graph tree map nexus conditioner largest amount sales every items whole personnel department largest one takes half rectangle tree map tree graph second largest department grocery followed paper products chose represent information different graph one's horizontal bar graph depends guess visualize comprehend grasp viewing analyzing data one see nexus conditioner largest item largest amount sales similar former graph treat tree graph different different types information i'm going going dashboard chose two visualizations sales item florida bottom sales department four cities thought visualizations complement pretty well top graph geographical one see departments see items sold geographically puts perspective think large metropolitan cities jacksonville miami tampa know st. fall right gonna amount sales makes sense clearly kind decided break information trip breaking categories breaking departments see nexus conditioner twelve point two almost whole point three million i'm gonna largest warned jacksonville sales personal department five point almost five point eight million that's that's huge that's lot see lot red map see lot red geographical one alright i'm going transition story felt like story sorry turn notifications felt like story really confusing first felt like reiterating every single thing saying story actually helped back back worksheets adjust filter refill tur kind add maybe shapes sizes represent greater amount sales actually helped make sense head starting first part story wanted abroad want broad whole united states wanted wanted abroad chose filter region chose south florida sales make sense okay let's take look florida we're florida florida cities display primary department sales initially department span initially pie charts size going back thought represent sales within size pie chart that's one adjustments made geographic thought interesting thought really cool neat see sales divided cities florida clearly cities collie dancer know well-known wanted represent visual like different way chose played around different graphs tried tried know switching information rows columns decided tree tree graph tree map actually never seen tree map i'm still unclear called tree map see tree like giving rectangle able see know like see clearly department successful see personal clearly tell next one grocery maybe could questions-- dirt map know still tell bread know maybe little bit blue maybe maybe yellow really confident one really helps condensing information together let's see like mentioned shy show sales item apartment moved another way presenting information bar horizontal graph caught eye nexus conditioner looked almost twice much instance like bars grocery know nexus conditioner successful item market data given finally including dashboard story making work visualizations wanted compare two visual together complemented think work well i'm going something like pie charts florida i'm able visually geographically put know see head see know clearly computer screen graph break tree map know items personal department solo see items shampoo conditioner moving took look notes really learned assignment analyze data gonna lie really intimidated first opens assignment given whole lot data know even pick two even filter years included seven 2017 2018 data said given lot data thousands thousands numbers we're told okay analyze going choose present audience i'm sitting front screen probably hour even knowing decided filter filter data chose region chose region thinking know geographically know want section sectioned started playing filters playing rows columns able decide wanted present audience sales primary goal sales individual items within three different departments within state florida goal able kind work towards goal even though lot visualizations data i've chose represent different graph played around different graphs even know really trying represent intrigued primarily tree graph never seen something like something also learned data know every everybody art sales department made profit nobody none departments deficit cutting getting since personal department big i'm gonna talking grocery paper products increase sales departments increase promoting item well okay backtrack i'm gonna say item trying push diane high demand people wanting bars people wanting napkins know people need let's promote

that's even san antonio austin much either kind surprising really interesting mean huge metropolitan areas they're buying lot nature valley pro protein chewy bars thought really interesting sort like cool look trying get okay here's first dashboard two chose look sales department state first two analytics actually one one thought interesting confident combination analytics thought information presented within two important sort guideline based project also could understand many different ways could analytics example could taken similar tangent looked personal care products know paper products anything like thought accomplish similar goal different ways one map shows ones selling department it'll show state department one thing map lacks necessarily conjugate everything can't see whole like dominant california terms revenue really get sense like slightly shaded slightly shaded look one see comparison like dominant california actually interactive one chose make interactive default shows states let's say wanted look states southeast could look like florida could look georgia could look north carolina could look south carolina something thought cool like know actually trying sell products areas something would find super useful i'll give could look geographically like like trends line that's something find super interesting want look like southeast would cool would one way second dashboard sales groceries item already looked also diving specifically nature valley protein bars reason included two together thought one bottom one extension top one still proves valid point see throughout look grocery sales obviously like we've talking new york california texas states selling eat like hypothesis like texas huge state they're probably selling throughout state necessarily case look one look texas example they're mainly sold huge areas texas like dallas houston one point thought interesting think accomplished well two analytics used together story sort entire layout project sort going i've talking one's altered changed let back look that's one thing thought really cool tableau like charts change change one we're going looked showing well respective part department within state that's one thing i've talking thought good guideline started project thing we've already looked one couple times illustrating similar point different way way would probably prefer bar graphs wanted variety project one looking sales within grocery department like saying lot read within within chart that's took focused nature valley protein bars thing lot shading lot profit nature valley protein bars look everywhere like profit margins super high also goes back powerhouse states terms sales one point trying prove high metropolitan areas we're lot success nature valley protein bars thought interesting one showing like dashboard showing juxtaposed together they're know accomplishing similar purpose also showing data two different ways lastly sales groceries item focusing nature value protein chewy bars that's i'm dividing city one actually showing cities throughout united states cool see like even chicago sells lot new york city looked like philadelphia lot big cities last part presentation talking learned data tableau learned data big set data there's lot ways could went project even though think took good direction know almost done like wow another interesting trend could pursued probably said hundred different things speaks big data said also going hand tableau versatile way able manipulate data like gave know someone dataset told talk would get lost trying tableau versatile manipulate data set big that's think that's blow valuable skill although easiest thing navigate beginner like definitely see value thank much watching

story summarize story analysis starts understanding data given showing total sales profit item two year time period i'm looking chart lets understand items selling leading profit second chart lets see items sold least number sales occurring item analyzing data leads think possible reasons sales occurring one state less occurring another questions like napkin sales higher washington oregon begin form would let look potential outside factors influence sales fact really consider they're extraneous third chart show shows amount sales year lets see increase decrease item sales year year analyzing data lets make decision possibly stop sale product sales lowering profit fourth chart shows sales department instead item year using see department instead single item due see department instead single item declining sales viewing data cite changes need made within department instead focusing specific items need work items better others using dashboard helps view item sales year easier well since next first chart use first graph reference point see percentage total sales item contributed specific year moving forward think company focus personal items like conditioner cream men even though see fourth graph sales profit decreasing still still creates huge profit margin two departments think company focus focus personal every item that's included personal potentially increase sales order larger quantity likely larger amount sales larger profit end period also think company focus states bring bring profit like california net conditioner like washington napkins throughout project learned analyzing data retail stores easy task also learned location probably one important factors comes sales choosing right place sell specific item important major influence potential profit also

sales bar chart see stacking different states like sales see top performers like new york texas pennsylvania long well california they're going little higher saw profits sales usually profits come along sales see north dakota bottom sales well profits get broader sense kind trends could maybe find kind patterns wanted start broad sense data getting little specific see sales items show certain

essentially country region state zip code city sales date department item sales profit profit bin outside epu really seems overwhelming first first opened data like gonna first thought excel exactly made pivot tables pivot charts play around data mess around see felt thought maybe could hone really ended first look essentially kind translated done excel first look included profits sales date department item included specific year bar graph think i'm epitome hard teach old dog new tricks i'm big fan bar graphs they're easy simple understand thought like easiest way keep concise saw like well maybe something within regions get first saw bunch downs really understand much moved department region included year sale 2017 2018 well different departments specific regions bottom right jump like well see significant decrease three i'm sorry three departments regions probably significant paper products looked said okay well kind see east central south regions mostly east bigger gap opposed even though two smaller gap seems that's used went ahead department map dates department used actually specifically used paper products saw paper products kind problematic last data set last visualization went ahead looked maps thought really interesting kind correlated perfectly beliefs east starts see memorable white screen really quick started see lot decrease there's almost none there's much smaller south well see lot decrease like okay see south entire east similar problem see colors different thought red important one even though previously using pink continued use pink rest graphs favorite color case hard guess thought red important kind stands went ahead another bar graph one kind spare visualization even within requirements thought important thought would nice see way i'm comfortable lot easier see drastic gap 2017 specifically east see highest bar 2017 lacking severely 2018 compared previous year made sure keep profits actually smallest sales i'm sorry went ahead put sales millions want clutter many numbers really love way looked that's part bar graphs like keep things concise guess bring back next one facts figures okay probably favorite one let see wanna scoot bit probably favorite love numbers part i'm finance major love look differences like able math head able switch things around quickly one's little interactive currently clicked paper products profits 2017 2018 region thought important able see numbers big different first thing stands big gap i've continually seen every single visualization prior one biggest gap always east close ted actually grand case huge something definitely stand grocery store business really they're looking analyzing data company thought important also one favorite things color scheme like said pink one favorite colors seeing change color also really big deal right show lighter colors gets closer white pale well got darker end like okay we're seeing real profit good thing filters changed automatically right click click grocery even want know groceries let's say know personal either mine set wanted get rid paper products include personal instead wanted see grocery next convenient thought really cool feature bars thought also really cool see favorite colors like visual aspect really thought presenting business meeting presenting higher-ups one-on-one setting presenting would large group people thinking okay would make point stand put big screen require lot tiny little words people can't read seat could see say makes sense understand talking wants clue thinks take direction company section decided even deeper specific items performing well case would say paper towels definitely poorly east year compared previous year well facial tissues great saint see similar patterns west south overall would say paper products great like across board east would say facial tissue paper towels seeing biggest decline next set kind deeper i'm kind gonna leave automatic filters side want add grocery stuff want add personal stuff could ahead want add want cool yes paper products that's decided really focus named dashboard interesting that's thought really interesting facts figures stuff that's exactly included facts figures little profit bar also includes interactive piece filtered seat add stuff take stuff away that's region bars thing accent figures numbers person like ahead take look visual person look region's bars big picture kind person included first look thought important without really understand rest decided take approach kind working backwards started really decided take facts figures numbers really enjoyed following bars see exact point see color shapes something really draws attention decided way back see big picture kind understand data coming saw way even i'm explaining way someone could look data collected way organize say understand suggestion kind comes story described know first look visualizing data graph floor numbers business settings visualization kind something explained earlier spoke slide backwards approach ultimately would suggest would probably overall reducing paper products whole maybe venturing far paper products wasting production time money really making profit time effort would also suggest perhaps specifically east cutting back things like facial tissues believe perhaps know cutting paper towels specifically east well considering taking deeper look third suggestion thought would probably important think would important thing really deeper data sharp decline everything specifically paper products maybe regional thing maybe something that's happening locally maybe movement like green movement might happening want people recyclable things like overall think like awesome set data work think tableau really taught lot useful information use loved project probably favorite also really enjoyed able learn use camera camera software cuz thought really cool future projects stuff think

basically product distributed throughout united states bigger actual dot map basically much profit sales product one examples would probably new york city profit tell bigger profit sales compared say lakewood indicator color green also bigger dot visual representation comparison comparison thought really interesting lab really like visual representation minimal also like brief overview might looking data set really like lot since brief overview overview wanted create another sheet basically basically indicating what's what's missing could looking map created profit sales items distributed department still want focus profits sales product wanted see departments difference like outlier products departments stays pretty consistent see like papa details groceries bars nature paper products napkins personals conditioner staying relatively consistent one outlier seem right even grocery even department still stayed pretty consistent really like map showed nothing ordinary lot found really interesting let's see three really wanted focus prophecy sales one really intriguing really want focus profit sales product math would flap loved visual indicator colors size dots see one product better another product there's different states different parts country thought really interesting want back sheet want focus one profits sales product thought really interesting indicate amount like visual numbers well look map see colors side see numbers long thought really interesting see well see different types shampoos conditioners paper towels see cliff bars chewy protein bars also see like california texas new york always relatively higher compared states traffic population understandable thought really cool see map there's visual representation looking map specifically kept seeing trend really want focus next sheet saw trend california always better states matter department product distributed part california always stock runners pretty interesting largest state united states always higher profit margin compared like texas know florida anything really interesting able pinpoint trend map specifically thought really cool see one really want focus nexus metris conditioning
